* 500g/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons/6.30 g instant yeast
* 1 cup / 240ml of whole milk( room temperature)
* ½ cup/ 120ml of warm water
* 30 g/ 2 Tablespoons unsalted butter( room temperature)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* Egg Wash – one large egg yolk and 1/2 teaspoon water/ milk.

## Method
* __Remember:__ to make something to fill - check *Sambol Recipes* in this site.
* Combine flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and butter in a large bowl.
* Make a well in the center.
* Add warm water and milk to the flour mixture and knead it to form a very soft dough.
* Next, turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead the dough for 10 minutes or until the dough springs back.
* Put the dough into an oiled bowl and cover the bowl with cling wrap and leave it somewhere warm for 1 hour or till the dough is doubled in size.
* After an hour, punch the dough down, leave it to rest for 10 minutes and shape the dough
* Divide the dough into half. Next, roll each half into a log and divide each log into 10 equal size pieces for mini buns.
* Roll each ball of dough into about 3-inch circles. 
* Place 1/2 Tablespoon of filling (fish, meat or seeni-Sambol) in the center. 
* Bring the upper right corner of the circle to the center. Next, bring the upper left corner of the circle and overlap it, and slightly pinch the edges.  Lastly, overlap the bottom part of the circle, slightly pinch to make a triangular-shaped bun.
* Place the triangular buns on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Cover and let it rise until double in size, about 40 minutes. (depends on how warm the room is)
* Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 190° C ( if fan forced 170° C )
* After 40 minutes, gently brush Egg wash on top of the buns.
* Bake the buns till golden brown for 15 min.
* Once you remove the buns off the oven, apply little butter on top to make the buns crust soft. (optional)
