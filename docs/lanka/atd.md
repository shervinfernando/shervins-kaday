# Devilled Potatoes – Sri Lankan Potato Fry (Ala Thel Dala)

## Ingredients

* 500g potatoes boiled, peeled and cut into cubes(1-inch roughly)
* 1 large onions sliced fine
* 4 or 5 curry leaves
* 4 cardamom pods slightly bruised
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp red chilli flecks 
* 1 tsp red chilli powder
* 1 large green chilli slit lengthwise.
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 2 tbsp Maldive fish
* 6 tbsp of oil

## Method

### HOW TO PARBOIL THE POTATOES.

* Place the potatoes(with skin)in a pan, pour water just enough to cover the potatoes.
* Boil the potatoes until they are tender. you can check if they are done by inserting a knife through the potatoes if the knife goes through smoothly, the potatoes are done.
* Place the potatoes under running water and peel off the skin.
* Since they are already boiled and soft, the potatoes will break into smaller cubes as you mix them with the spices, so cut them into larger cubes and set aside.

### HOW TO COOK THE DEVIL POTATOES.

* Have all the ingredients needed to make the spicy potato dish ready.
* Place a cooking pan over medium heat and pour in the oil, add curry leaves, cardamom pods, Maldive fish, Onions and sauté.
* Once the onion slices turn golden, add turmeric powder, cumin, add red chilli flecks, red chilli powder, green chillies and finally, mustard seeds.
* reduce heat and continue cooking the ingredients in the pan while mixing to avoid any of the spices from burning for 2 minutes.
* Add the cooked potatoes to the spices, season with salt and combine potatoes with the tempered ingredients. pour in a tablespoon of oil if you need the mixing to go smoothly.
