# Beef Fry

## Ingredients

* 1 kg beef sirloin or rump or gravy beef(cut into 1 and 1/2 inch cubes, preferably without fat)
* 1 tsp of salt.
* 3 tsp of pepper powder
* 3 tsp of cumin powder.
* water just enough to cover the beef.
* 1/4 cup of tamarind juice or if you are using tamarind pulp then 1 and 1/2 tsp
* 1/4 cup of oil to fry the beef
* 1 tbsp of crushed Garlic and Ginger.
* 3 tbsp Balsamic vinegar 
* 1/2 tsp chilli flecks

## Method

* Clean and trim the excess fat off the meat and slice the beef into flat strips.
* Season the beef with salt, cumin and pepper powder, vinegar, garlic and ginger.
* Let the beef marinate for 30 minutes. leave it longer(1 to 2 hours if possible)
* Place the Beef slices in a pan(preferably nonstick)and pour in water just enough to cover the beef.
* Cover with a lid and boil the beef, maintain medium heat and cook for 45 to 1 hour, this should help the Beef cook thoroughly.
* Remove the lid and continue to cook until the spices and water is reduced and takes on a thicker consistency.
* Add the tamarind juice and continue to cook over low medium heat.  Let the liquid completely be absorbed by the beef chunks.
* Once the moisture is completely absorbed, gradually pour in the oil and leave it to fry the beef over low-medium fire.
* The Beef should fry and change into almost dark brown-black in color and give out a sizzling noise as it fries.
* Just before you take the pan off the heat, add the chilli flecks and mix well.
* Serve with a few pieces of lime wedges.
