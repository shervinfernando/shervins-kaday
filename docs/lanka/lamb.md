# Sinhalese lamb curry

## Ingredients

* 1 kg of lamb - preferably with some marrow bones
* juice of 1 lime
* 400ml of coconut milk or substitute with normal milk (optional)
* 2 cups of water

### For Marinade
* 10 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 10 cm of piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped
* 2 tbsp of Dark Roasted Curry powder
* 1 tbsp of Chilli powder
* 1 tbsp of crushed Pepper powder
* 1 tsp of ground turmeric
* 3 tbsp of Balsamic vinegar
* 1.5 teaspoon of salt

### For Frying
* 4 tbsp of oil
* ½ tsp of cumin seeds (optional)
* ½ tsp of fenugreek seeds
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 2 2.5 cm (1 inch) cinnamon sticks
* 6 cardamom pods
* 6 cloves
* 2 2.5 cm (1 inch) pieces of rampe (pandan) leaf
* 10 fresh curry leaves
* 1 lemongrass stalk (optional)
* 2 green chillies, slit lengthways and deseeded
* 1 large onion, finely chopped

## Method

* Wash the meat, cut it into 2.5 cm (1 inch) chunks and put it in a large bowl. Add all the ingredients for the marinade and mix it all together by hand, rubbing it into the meat.
* Leave to marinate for at-least 2 hours (I keep it overnight).
* Heat the oil in a large, lidded saucepan over a medium heat. Add the cumin seeds (if using), fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon, cardamom pods, cloves, rampe leaf, curry leaves, lemongrass (if using), green chillies and onion, and sauté until the onions are soft and turning golden.
* Add the marinated meat after at-least 5-10 min, add water (to cover the meat or say 2 cups of water), and bring to the boil.
* Put the lid on and cook on a medium heat for about 45 minutes, until the water has evaporated and the meat is cooked through.
* Add the coconut milk (optional), mix well and simmer for another 10–15 minutes until the sauce is thick.
* Remove from the heat and squeeze in the lime juice.
