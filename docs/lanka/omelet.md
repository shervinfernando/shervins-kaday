# Lankan Breakfast Omelet

## Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 4 tbsp of thick coconut milk(you can substitute with fresh milk)
* 1/2 tsp of Pepper
* 3 tbsp of oil
* 1 medium-sized Onions chopped fine
* 1/2 tsp of crushed musterd seeds 
* 1 medium-sized Tomatoes chopped fine
* 2 green chillies chopped fine
* A sprig of curry leaves
* A pinch(1/8th of a tsp) turmeric powder
* 1/2 to 1 tsp of chilli flecks
* Fresh Coriander or your favorite herb to garnish
* Salt to taste.


## Method

* Have all the ingredients in hand before you begin with the omelet.
* Crack the eggs in a bowl, add the coconut milk and whisk them together, season with pepper and set aside. 
* Place the pan over low heat and warm it for a few seconds.
* Pour in the oil and spread it over the frying pan.
* Add the chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, curry leaves, musterd, turmeric and chilli flecks.
* Season the ingredients with salt while the ingredients continue to sauté, cook until the onions and tomatoes turn soft over low heat(3-5 minutes).
* Once the ingredients are cooked, spread them lightly over the frying pan surface with a spoon, make sure you have the cooked mixture spread evenly.
* Pour the egg mixture to the pan(give the eggs a stir before following this instruction), make sure the egg mixture spreads evenly over the cooked ingredients that are already in the pan.
* Immediately cover the frying pan with a lid, maintain low fire and continue cooking the omelet. Avoid shaking the pan or using a spoon while the omelet cooks.
* If you find the bottom of the omelet too dry while it cooks, drizzle a bit of oil around the edges of the eggs, this makes it crisper as well.
* Once the top layer of the omelet is cooked, add your favorite herb, I’m adding chopped coriander here..
